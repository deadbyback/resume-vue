    <p>
      I am a programmer and web developer with experience in geospatial data,
      agricultural machinery parsing and API development. I am fluent in
      Ukrainian and Russian; English at intermediate level. I can adapt to
      non-standard requirements and solve complex tasks. In addition to the core
      PHP stack, I have commercial experience with Python, .NET, Node.js, and
      non-commercial experience with Golang, C++. Now I'm mostly involved with
      backend tasks.
